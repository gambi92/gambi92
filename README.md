### 👋 Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub corner!

I'm Daniel, a perpetual learner with an insatiable curiosity for all things tech. When I'm not glued to my keyboard, you can catch me exploring the vast digital landscapes of video games.

🚴‍♂️ Beyond the virtual realms, I'm an enthusiastic cyclist, embracing the wind in my "hair" as I pedal through the great outdoors. It's not just a form of exercise; it's a therapeutic escape that complements my ever-curious mind.

🍿 When the pixels settle, I shift gears to indulge in the cinematic movies, TV shows, and anime. A well-told story, be it on the screen or in code, never fails to captivate my attention.

Currently, I'm immersed in the creation of **DigiDent** (maybe I will change the name to DentalTech), a comprehensive software solution designed to empower dentists and enhance patient care.

* **Appointment Management**: Streamlining scheduling to optimize clinic efficiency.
* **Patient Records**: Secure and organized digital records for accurate and accessible patient information.
* **Diagnostic Tools Integration**: Harnessing technology for advanced diagnostics and treatment planning.
* **Automation**: Reducing administrative burdens through intelligent automation.

⚙️ Tech Stack:

* **Backend**: Spring Boot REST API with MySQL database and Flyway migrations
* **Frontend**: React with a template
